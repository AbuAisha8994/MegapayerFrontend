                    Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
                    Services shall be resolved through binding arbitration in
                    accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration

                    consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a
                    claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you
                    waive any right to a jury trial.
