## Solving Common Issues

### SWC Compiler Errors

On Windows, you might encounter issues with the SWC compiler. We've provided several solutions:

1. Use the `launch.bat` script which sets appropriate environment variables and fallbacks
2. Use Babel instead of SWC by creating a .babelrc file
3. Update next.config.js to disable SWC
