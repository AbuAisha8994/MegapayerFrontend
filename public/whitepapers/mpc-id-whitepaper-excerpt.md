## 2. Architecture Framework

### 2.1 Core Components

The MPC ID system consists of several interconnected components:

```javascript
const mpcIdArchitecture = {
  identityNFT: {
    purpose: "Unique identity representation on blockchain",
    features: [
      "Cryptographic uniqueness",
      "Ownership verification",
      "Metadata storage",
    ],
    standard: "MPC-721 Enhanced NFT",
  },
  credentialSystem: {
    purpose: "Verifiable digital credentials and certificates",
    features: [
      "Academic degrees",
      "Professional certifications",
      "Skill validations",
    ],
    protocol: "W3C Verifiable Credentials + Zero-Knowledge Proofs",
  },
  authenticationEngine: {
    purpose: "Cross-platform authentication and authorization",
    features: ["Single sign-on", "Multi-factor auth", "Biometric integration"],
    protocols: ["OAuth 2.0", "OpenID Connect", "Web3 wallet integration"],
  },
  privacyLayer: {

      "Anonymous credentials",
      "Privacy controls",
    ],
    technology: "zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs",
  },
};
```

### 2.2 NFT Identity Structure

Each MPC ID is represented by a unique NFT with comprehensive metadata:

```solidity
contract MPCIdentity {
    struct IdentityData {
        uint256 tokenId;           // Unique identifier
        address owner;             // Current owner address
        string publicProfile;      // Public metadata URI
        bytes32 privateDataHash;   // Hash of encrypted private data
        uint256 creationTime;      // Identity creation timestamp
        uint256 lastUpdate;       // Last modification time
        bool isVerified;           // Verification status
        mapping(string => bytes32) credentials; // Verifiable credentials
    }

    mapping(uint256 => IdentityData) public identities;
    mapping(address => uint256) public ownerToId;

    event IdentityCreated(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed owner);
    event CredentialAdded(uint256 indexed tokenId, string credentialType);
    event VerificationStatusChanged(uint256 indexed tokenId, bool verified);
}
```

### 2.3 Zero-Knowledge Proof Integration

Privacy-preserving verification through advanced cryptographic protocols:

```javascript
const zkProofSystem = {
  proofTypes: {
    ageVerification: {
      purpose: "Prove age without revealing exact birthdate",
      circuit: "Age >= 18 AND Age <= 150",
      privacy: "Birthdate remains private",
    },
    credentialProof: {
      purpose: "Prove possession of credential without revealing details",
      circuit: "HasDegree('Computer Science') AND University.isAccredited",
      privacy: "Specific grades and graduation date private",
    },
    residencyProof: {
      purpose: "Prove residence in jurisdiction without exact address",
      circuit: "Address.country == 'US' AND Address.state == 'California'",
      privacy: "Street address remains private",
    },
  },
  implementation: {
    library: "snarkjs v0.8.x",
    curve: "bn128",
    ceremony: "Powers of Tau Phase 2",
    circuitLanguage: "Circom 2.0",
  },
};
```

## 3. Identity Creation and Management

### 3.1 Identity Generation Process

The MPC ID creation process ensures uniqueness and security:

1. **Biometric Capture**: Optional biometric data for enhanced security
2. **Cryptographic Key Generation**: Ed25519 keypair for identity operations
3. **NFT Minting**: Unique identity NFT creation on Megapayer Chain
4. **Metadata Association**: Linking of public and private identity data
5. **Initial Verification**: Basic identity verification and validation

```javascript
class MPCIdentityCreator {
  async createIdentity(userData) {
    // Generate cryptographic keypair
    const keyPair = await crypto.generateKey("Ed25519", true, [
      "sign",
      "verify",
    ]);

    // Create unique identity hash
    const identityHash = await this.generateIdentityHash(
      userData,
      keyPair.publicKey
    );

    // Mint identity NFT
    const nftId = await this.mintIdentityNFT(identityHash);

    // Encrypt and store private data
    const encryptedData = await this.encryptPrivateData(userData);

    // Store on IPFS with encryption
    const metadataURI = await this.storeMetadata(encryptedData);

    return {
      nftId,
      publicKey: keyPair.publicKey,
      privateKey: keyPair.privateKey,
      metadataURI,
    };
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Credential Management

MPC ID supports various types of verifiable credentials:

```solidity
contract CredentialRegistry {
    enum CredentialType {
        EDUCATION,      // Academic degrees and certificates
        PROFESSIONAL,   // Work experience and skills
        GOVERNMENT,     // Official government documents
        SOCIAL,         // Social media and community validation
        FINANCIAL,      // Credit scores and financial history
        HEALTH,         // Medical records and health certificates
        CUSTOM          // User-defined credential types
    }

    struct Credential {
        CredentialType credType;
        address issuer;
        string credentialData;
        uint256 issueDate;
        uint256 expiryDate;
        bool isRevoked;
        bytes signature;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => mapping(bytes32 => Credential)) public credentials;
    mapping(address => bool) public authorizedIssuers;
}
```
